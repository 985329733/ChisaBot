 * connectors nobody has added yet, and a person's own skill outlives the server it was written
 * against. Rendering only what matched meant the screen showed a subset of the declaration and
 * presented it as the whole thing — a skill needing two tools drew one, and nothing said the other
 * was there. Editing it silently kept a tool the author had just been shown they did not have.
 *
 * A wrong number on a screen somebody governs with is worse than no number, so the leftovers are
 * named rather than dropped. They are not an error: a ref for a connector that does not exist here
 * loads nothing, because the offer is intersected with the Bot's grants.
